# Object-Oriented-Programming-Final
This project was developed during my **Object-Oriented Programming II** class in Spring 2022 at the Illinois Institute of Technology. At the time, I was relatively new to programming. The project built upon concepts learned in **Object-Oriented Programming I** from the previous semester and reinforced key object-oriented principles, including classes and objects, inheritance, abstraction, and more.

This project is written entirely in **Java** and leverages object-oriented programming principles to develop a database system for an educational institution.
